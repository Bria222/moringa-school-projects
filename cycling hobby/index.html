        Cycling in one form or another plays a major role in my life. Whether it’s commuting to work and around the city,
        fundraising for worthy causes or teaching indoor cycling, I spend lots of my free time on a bike. And I love it.
        From the moment I learned how to ride, my bike was my ticket to freedom. It’s been that way ever since I was a kid
        and goes double for life these days as we shelter in place for what is now my eighth week.
        When in mombasa was ordered to shelter in place in mid-March, it became clear I would no longer be commuting to work,
        teaching spin classes at the gym, nor would I do my favorite annual charity ride, covid 19 Cycle creating awareness.
        My life on the bike is just fasceneting. being on the saddle relieves me makes me feel focusedand it is helthy
